1. Add CloudVocal as a filter to your audio source
1. Configure your cloud provider credentials in the plugin settings
1. Select your desired transcription and translation options

## Building

The plugin can be built on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. The build process is straightforward as all processing happens in the cloud.

Both Mac OSX and Linux rely on Conan for dependencies. Install Conan, e.g. `pip install conan`, and install the dependencies:
```sh
$ conan profile detect --force
$ conan install . --output-folder=./build_conan --build=missing -g CMakeDeps
```

### Mac OSX

Build the plugin:

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-macos --config Release
```

You may want to change to `RelWithDebInfo` for a debug build.

If you're developing the plugin, I find this command to be useful for direct deploymet into OBS after building:

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-macos --skip-deps && cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/*.plugin ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/
```

### Linux

Build the plugin:
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-linux
```

### Windows

Windows also needs Conan for OpenSSL. Run `conan` to get the dependency (make sure to run `conan` on the `conanfile_win.txt`):
```powershell
> pip install conan
> conan profile detect --force
> conan install .\conanfile_win.txt --output-folder=./build_conan --build=missing -g CMakeDeps
```

Build the plugin:

```powershell
> .\.github\scripts\Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

If you're developing the plugin, I find this command to be useful for direct deploymet into OBS after building:

```powershell
> pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\.github\scripts\Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration RelWithDebInfo -SkipDeps && Copy-Item -Force -Recurse .\release\RelWithDebInfo\* "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\"
```
